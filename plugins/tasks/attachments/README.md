# Task attachment HTTP surface

Attachment upload uses a raw request body at
`POST /api/v1/plugins/<plugin-id>/http/attachments/upload`. Raw bytes are the
simplest supported format, but local-auth non-GET plugin routes require JSON,
so upload uses plugin-token auth. Pass the token in `x-bb-plugin-token` (or the
`token` query parameter).

Upload metadata may use query parameters (`taskId` or `commentId`, `fileName`,
and `mime`) or the corresponding `x-task-id`, `x-comment-id`, `x-file-name`,
and `x-mime-type` headers. Exactly one owner is required. The response is
`{ attachmentId, url }`.

The returned local-auth frontend URL is
`GET /api/v1/plugins/<plugin-id>/http/attachments/download?attachmentId=...`.
Deletion is
`DELETE /api/v1/plugins/<plugin-id>/http/attachments/delete?attachmentId=...`
and,
because it is a local-auth non-GET request, must use `Content-Type:
application/json`.

Attachment URLs are persisted in task descriptions and intentionally bind the
content to the plugin's runtime ID. Do not rename an installed Tasks plugin
after attachments have been used (in particular, keep `tasks-linear` stable).
