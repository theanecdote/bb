# Tasks

Tasks is a Linear-style tracker inside bb for planning work, delegating it to
agents, and keeping the task record connected to the threads doing the work.
It provides projects and folders, task keys, statuses and priorities, labels,
subtasks, Markdown comments, attachments, agent presets, and a full CLI.

## Install

Enable **Plugins** under Settings → Experiments, then install Tasks — an
official plugin bundled with the app:

```sh
bb plugin install tasks
```

The plugin adds the Tasks sidebar panel, the `bb tasks` command, and an agent
skill that teaches workers how to report progress back to tasks.

## Quick start

First enable **Plugins** under Settings → Experiments and install the plugin
with `bb plugin install tasks`. Then use the `bb tasks` CLI to
create a tracker project and link it to the bb project where delegated agents
should run:

```sh
bb tasks project create \
  --name "Product" \
  --prefix PROD \
  --link-bb-project proj_your_bb_project

bb tasks create \
  --project PROD \
  --title "Ship task delegation" \
  --description "Implement the flow and run focused validation." \
  --priority high

bb tasks list --project PROD
bb tasks show PROD-1
bb tasks preset list
bb tasks delegate PROD-1 --preset "GPT-5.6 · high"
```

When the CLI runs inside a linked bb project, `create` and `list` infer the
tracker project, so `--project` can be omitted. Task keys are case-insensitive
at the CLI boundary. You can also delegate from a task's **Delegate** menu,
choose or create presets under **Manage → Presets**, and type `@` in the bb
composer to send a task mention to an agent.

The comment composer shows a **Notify last responding agent** switch. When the
task has an agent reply, leave it on to send the new comment to the thread that
authored the latest reply, resuming that thread when it is idle. Turn it off to
keep the comment in Tasks only. If no agent has replied, the disabled control
says so explicitly. Agents and scripts can use the same behavior with
`bb tasks comment PROD-1 --body "New context" --notify`.
When run from a thread, the CLI preserves that agent thread and any explicit
`--author`; notification still targets the prior latest responder rather than
the newly recorded agent comment itself.

## CLI reference

Run `bb tasks --help` or `bb tasks <command> --help` for exact options. Add
`--json` to commands when another command or agent will consume the output.
File paths (`--file`, `--attach`, `--out`, `--description-file`, `--body-file`)
resolve on the invoking machine: inside an agent thread that is the thread's
machine, otherwise the server's machine; pass `--machine <id-or-name>` to
target another enrolled machine.

Statuses are `backlog`, `todo`, `in_progress`, `in_review`, `done`, and
`canceled`. Priorities are `urgent`, `high`, `medium`, `low`, and `none`.

Task lists default to 100 rows and accept `--limit 1-500`. JSON output is
`{ tasks, nextCursor, limit }`; human output prints the continuation option
when another page exists. The cursor is opaque and tied to the filters, sort,
and current task-list revision. If tasks are added, removed, reordered, or
updated between requests—or label links/names, active task threads, or project
prefixes change—the old cursor is rejected. Restart from the first page rather
than traversing an inconsistent snapshot.

## Agents, delegation, and presets

Linking a Tasks project to a bb project enables delegation. Open a task, choose
**Delegate**, select a preset, and optionally add instructions. A preset
defines the provider, model, reasoning level, permission mode, and reusable
instructions. Presets are user-defined, so create the worker profiles your team
uses repeatedly before dispatching work.

Delegation creates a worker thread in the linked bb project, attaches that
thread to the task, and advances a `backlog` or `todo` task to `in_progress`.
The worker receives the task description, subtasks, attachments, recent
comments, preset instructions, and a report-back contract. Its installed Tasks
skill tells it to inspect the task, leave substantive milestone comments,
attach artifacts, and move completed work to `in_review`.

If work begins outside the Delegate action, the agent can associate its current
thread with `bb tasks attach KEY`.

## Task mentions

Type `@` in the bb composer and select **Tasks** to search by task key or title.
Sending the mention gives the agent the task's description, status, priority,
labels, subtasks, attachments, recent comments, attached threads, and CLI
action contract as context. Tasks linked to the current bb project rank first.

Inside a task description or comment, `@` also inserts a task pill. These
references are stored in Markdown as `[PROD-1](bbtask://PROD-1)`, so they remain
portable in task content.

Mentioning a task key such as `PROD-1` in an agent request also activates the
Tasks skill, which directs the worker to read and update the tracked task.

## Linear integration operation

The Linear-enabled replacement is deployed from the merged
`https://github.com/theanecdote/bb` fork checkout, never from an upstream PR.
Keep the bundled `tasks` plugin disabled and install the checkout as a local
path plugin:

```sh
bb plugin install --yes path:<deployment-worktree>/plugins/tasks
```

The persistent deployment worktree must have package name
`bb-plugin-tasks-linear` and display name `Tasks + Linear`; run
`pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile`, build `@bb/plugin-sdk`, and then build
`bb-plugin-tasks-linear`. The local manifest and lockfile changes are deployment
state and must not be pushed. Before every reinstall or reload after a git
operation, verify that `node -p "require('./plugins/tasks/package.json').name"`
still prints `bb-plugin-tasks-linear`. BB derives frontend metadata and CSS
scope from that name, so a silently reverted rename can produce an incorrectly
styled app even if registration remains `tasks-linear`. Do not force-add
`dist`, hand-edit artifact metadata, or create a distribution branch.

The installed plugin ID must be `tasks-linear`, while its command remains
`bb tasks`. It owns a database separate from the disabled builtin `tasks`
plugin; replacement data is not migrated between them. Persisted attachment
URLs contain the plugin ID, so once this replacement is used, `tasks-linear`
is permanent and must not be renamed again. Keep the builtin disabled to avoid
a CLI collision.

Create a Linear personal API key in Linear's settings. Enter it only in the
plugin's **Linear API key** secret setting in BB, then reload and enable the
plugin. Never put the key in CLI arguments, chat, logs, RPC output, or source.
For healthy rotation, create the replacement key first, update the BB secret
setting, reload the plugin so the next operation uses it, run a successful
manual sync, and only then revoke the old key. `LINEAR_SMOKE_API_KEY` is solely
an opt-in developer variable for the read-only smoke test; production does not
read it.

Synchronization starts when the configured plugin starts, polls every five
minutes, and can be requested with **Sync now** or `bb tasks linear sync`.
`bb tasks linear status` reports connection, viewer, last success, active
mapping count, and safe errors. Concurrent sync requests share one run. Rate
limits suppress scheduled work until Linear's reported retry time; use a later
manual sync rather than expecting an autonomous retry loop. The integration
uses polling only: do not expose a webhook or public share.

Linear is authoritative for mapped issue status, title, description, priority,
and due date. Mapped projects are import-only, so tasks cannot be created in
them locally. Link each imported Tasks project to the correct BB project before
delegating; delegation is unavailable until then. Linear sub-issues are
flattened into independent BB tasks. Labels and subtasks remain local.
Attachments on mapped tasks or their comments are rejected, as are user
comments containing BB attachment URLs. Ordinary user comments are written to
Linear; agent and system comments remain local.

After installation, manually sync and verify the authenticated viewer, exact
issue keys, and no duplicates before linking a project. Installation and smoke
checks must not mutate Linear: confirm no unexpected comments, state changes,
or other issue edits, and confirm no key appears in git, logs, or RPC output.

### Rollback

Disable and remove `tasks-linear`; its separate data is not migrated back.
Re-enable `builtin:tasks` when the builtin resolves from a packaged copy or a
different source checkout. Only when BB itself runs from the deployment
worktree, first restore the package name to `bb-plugin-tasks`, run
`pnpm install`, and then re-enable the builtin plugin. Rollback must not create
an upstream PR, webhook/public share, or Linear mutation.

## Known limitations

- The **Auto** delegation preset is deferred; choose an explicit preset.
- List filters are local UI state and are not persisted in the URL.

## Fast follow

- Batch task-list enrichment for comments and attached-thread state.
- Add notifications and an inbox for task activity.
- Add a command palette entry for Tasks to cmd-K.
