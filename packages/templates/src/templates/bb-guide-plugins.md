title: bb Guide — Plugins
summary: Command reference for installing, configuring, running, and authoring bb plugins and their contributed CLI commands.
intent: Provide complete plugin command documentation plus an authoring walkthrough for agents and humans building bb plugins.
editingNotes: Keep flags accurate against the CLI implementation (apps/cli/src/commands/plugin.ts) and the server plugin service; a CLI test asserts every `bb plugin` subcommand appears in this chapter. The full authoring reference is the bb-plugin-authoring builtin skill.

Plugin commands

A bb plugin is a TypeScript package that extends the bb server in-process:
background services, cron schedules, HTTP/RPC endpoints, thread lifecycle
handlers, settings, storage — and `bb` CLI subcommands that agents and humans
run like any other command. Plugins are full-trust code inside the server.

Plugins are on by default. Builtin plugins (`builtin:<name>`) ship with bb;
user-installed plugins come from `bb plugin install` or the official store.
Plugin state lives under `<bb-data-dir>/plugins/<id>/` (per-plugin SQLite file,
secrets, logs).

The builtin Custom instructions plugin adds a multiline editor under Settings
→ Custom instructions. Saved text is persisted on this bb host and included in
agent task instructions; blank text contributes nothing.

The builtin Workflows plugin runs durable provider-independent JavaScript
orchestration. It is disabled on fresh installations; enable `workflows` under
Extensions → Plugins or run `bb plugin enable workflows` before using:

  bb workflows validate (--script '<javascript>'|--source '<javascript>'|
                        --file <path>|--name <name>)
  bb workflows run (--script '<javascript>'|--source '<javascript>'|
                   --file <path>|--name <name>)
                   [--args '<json>'] [--resume <run-id>]
  bb workflows status <run-id>
  bb workflows history <run-id> [--cursor <call-index>] [--limit <1-100>]
  bb workflows list [--limit <1-50>]
  bb workflows stop <run-id>

Commands must run from a BB project thread. Workflows has six plugin
settings, configurable with `bb plugin config workflows set <key> <value>`:
`maxActiveRuns` (default 4, range 1–32), `maxConcurrentAgents` (8, 1–64),
`maxAgentCalls` (100, 1–1000), `totalRunTimeoutMs` (86400000, 60000–604800000),
`retentionDays` (30, 1–3650), and `maxNotificationBytes` (16384,
1024–262144). `maxActiveRuns` applies live; the other five are snapshotted for
each new run. Settings changes do not require a plugin reload.

`status` is a bounded polling summary, and `list` returns only compact run
summaries. Detailed run and call records are paged JSONL: redirect `history`
into `$BB_THREAD_STORAGE` before inspecting it, and continue with the final
page record's `nextCursor`. The invoking shell writes
that file on the thread's execution host, so this works the same on local and
remote hosts without granting the plugin arbitrary filesystem access. Use `bb
provider list --environment "$BB_ENVIRONMENT_ID" --json` and then `bb provider
models <provider-id> --environment "$BB_ENVIRONMENT_ID" --json` before writing
an explicit selection; never guess ACP model IDs.

The Memory plugin is an opt-in install, bundled with the app:
`bb plugin install memory`. Once installed, it injects a compact global and
current-project memory index into agent context and progressively discloses
full records through CLI-only commands. Because its store works across
providers, we recommend disabling provider-native memory under Settings →
Providers to avoid duplicate or conflicting stores. Settings → Memory lists
every global and project memory and supports version-checked edits and soft
deletion.

  bb memory catalog [--scope project|global|all] [--json]
  bb memory search <query> [--scope project|global|all] [--json]
  bb memory get <id> [--scope project|global|all] [--json]
  bb memory add --scope project|global --name <name> --summary <text>
                --details <text> --reason <text> [--kind <kind>]
                [--tag <tag>]... [--importance <0-100>] [--pinned] [--json]
  bb memory update <id> --expected-version <n> [fields...] [--json]
  bb memory forget <id> --expected-version <n> --reason <text> [--json]
  bb memory history <id> [--scope project|global|all] [--limit 1-100] [--json]

Project writes use the invoking CLI's current project. Global writes require
the explicit `--scope global` flag.

The Docs plugin is an opt-in official plugin bundled with the app:
`bb plugin install docs`. Read-only discovery remains direct, while edits use
a manifest-backed local workspace:

  bb docs vaults [--json]
  bb docs list [--vault <id>] [--json]
  bb docs read <path> [--vault <id>]
  bb docs pull <path> [--folder] [--vault <id>] [--into <dir>]
  bb docs pull --all [--vault <id>] [--into <dir>]
  bb docs status [workspace-dir] [--delete] [--diff] [--json]
  bb docs push [workspace-dir] [--delete] [--dry-run] [--diff] [--json]

Pull preserves vault-relative paths and writes `.bb-docs-state.json`; edit the
ordinary files and leave that state file untouched. Push uses pulled SHA-256
versions as compare-and-swap guards. Concurrent changes stop with exit 3.
Local file and empty-directory deletions are warnings unless `--delete` is
explicit; a pulled folder root is retained, so pull its parent or the whole
vault to remove that folder. Use `--workspace-host <id>` when a standalone
CLI's working directory is on a non-primary host. Direct `write`, `mkdir`,
`move`, and `remove` remain only as deprecated compatibility commands.

The Tasks plugin is an opt-in official plugin bundled with the app:
`bb plugin install tasks`. It adds a task tracker, agent delegation,
and the `bb tasks` command. Common agent operations are:

  bb tasks show <key-or-id> [--json]
  bb tasks list [--project <prefix-or-id>] [filters...] [--sort manual|priority|due] [--limit 1-500] [--cursor <opaque>] [--json]
  bb tasks comment <key-or-id> (--body <markdown> | --body-file <path>) [--json]
  bb tasks attachment add <key-or-comment-id> --file <path> [--json]
  bb tasks attachment get <attachment-id> --out <path> [--json]
  bb tasks attach <key-or-id> [--json]
  bb tasks update <key-or-id> --status in_review [--json]
  bb tasks update <key-or-id> (--parent <parent-key-or-id> | --no-parent) [--json]
  bb tasks linear status [--json]
  bb tasks linear sync [--json]

Run `bb tasks --help` for project, folder, task, label, attachment, and demo-data
commands, plus preset management, delegation, and attached-thread inspection.
Delegated threads are attached automatically; use `bb tasks attach` only when
work started outside Tasks. Task update resolves both task keys and IDs for
`--parent`; use `--no-parent` to promote a subtask to the top level. File paths
in tasks commands resolve on the invoking machine (the thread's machine inside
an agent thread, otherwise the server's); pass `--machine <id-or-name>` to
target another enrolled machine.
Linear synchronization is configured only through the secret plugin setting
`linearApiKey`; the Linear CLI commands neither accept nor print credentials.
Mapped projects are import-only and must be linked to a BB project before
delegation. Linear owns imported keys/numbers, title, description, priority,
due date, and workflow status; BB owns labels, hierarchy, color, local comments,
and attached threads. Mapped-task attachments are refused. `bb tasks comment`
posts user comments to Linear, while agent/system comments and Linear's existing
comment transcript are not mirrored.
Task lists default to 100 rows. JSON pages include `nextCursor`; human pages
print the exact continuation option when more rows exist. Cursors are bound to
the filters, sort, and task-list revision. Any add, removal, reorder, update,
label-link/name change, active-thread change, or project-prefix change invalidates an
outstanding cursor; restart without `--cursor` instead of accepting a mixed
snapshot.

The builtin Secrets plugin provides a secure credential form and guarded
dotenv reconciliation:

  bb secret request <NAME...> --write-env <path>
                    [--purpose <text>] [--describe <NAME> <text>]...

The command blocks until the user submits or cancels the form. Secret values
never appear in command arguments, model-visible output, or persisted
interaction data; success prints only the path, variable names, and
added/updated/unchanged counts.

BB Official plugins

BB's official plugins — GitHub, Docs, Memory, Tasks, and T3 Sidebar — ship
bundled inside the app itself. They appear in Extensions → Plugins → Browse
and install with one click from the local bundled copy: no network, no
download, no separate release. Install from the CLI by bare name
(`bb plugin install github`, `bb plugin install docs`,
`bb plugin install memory`, `bb plugin install tasks`, or
`bb plugin install t3sidebar`). Installed official plugins are pinned to the
bundled copy and update automatically when the BB app updates.

For direct git:/npm: installs, updates are manual: `bb plugin outdated`
checks tracking sources and `bb plugin update` applies compatible candidates.
Reinstalling an already-installed managed plugin is refused — use
`bb plugin update`. A failed activation restores the pre-update snapshot and
leaves the latest failure visible as needing attention. Exact npm versions,
git tags and commits, path sources, and bundled official plugins are pinned;
npm ranges/omitted specs/dist-tags and git branches track compatible updates.

`bb plugin search <query>` matches id, display name, description, and
category across the bundled official plugins (status: installed / compatible
/ requires newer bb). Install an official plugin by its bare name. Direct
`path:`, `npm:`, `git:`, and `builtin:` sources—and path-like
syntax—continue to bypass official-plugin resolution.

Builds are automatic once installed. Git installs run `npm install`
(lifecycle scripts disabled), then compile both bundles — so a git plugin may
depend on third-party packages. node_modules is kept, because bundling cannot
inline data files a dependency reads at runtime. A committed dist/ is always
replaced by the bundles bb builds. Path installs compile dist/ at install time
from dependencies you have already installed. A build failure fails the
install. npm packages must ship a metadata-validated prebuilt app or the
install is refused. The server rebuilds source-built apps after a bb upgrade.

Installing or updating a git plugin requires `npm` on PATH. Checking for
updates does not: a check reads the candidate's manifest and stops, so
polling never resolves a dependency tree or builds. A candidate that fails to
build is reported as available and fails when you apply it.

bb ships no build toolchain. The first time a git or path plugin is built on
a machine, bb downloads a pinned esbuild + Tailwind set into
`<dataDir>/plugins/toolchain-<versions>/` and reuses it afterwards. Installing
a prebuilt npm plugin never triggers that download.

To build a plugin yourself — in CI, or to check it compiles without a running
bb — depend on the published `bb-app` package and call the CLI:

```jsonc
// your plugin's package.json
"devDependencies": { "bb-app": "^0.35.1" },
"scripts": { "build": "bb plugin build" }
```

`bb plugin build` talks to no server. Depending on `bb-app@X` builds with
exactly that release's shim configuration, so the bundle cannot be built
against a mismatched host runtime. Cache the toolchain directory in CI to skip
the download on later runs. Only `bb plugin dev` needs a running bb, because
it reloads the installed plugin after each rebuild.

The backend half is prebuilt too: when a builtin/official/git/npm install
ships a dist/server.js built for the running SDK major, the server loads it
instead of the TypeScript source. Path installs always load server.ts from
source, so `bb plugin dev`/reload see edits immediately.

`bb plugin dev` is the edit loop: it requires the directory to already be
installed as a plugin (`bb plugin install .` first), ignores dist/,
node_modules/, and .git/, batches saves, and prints one line per cycle. A
build or reload failure prints the error and keeps watching (a failed build
skips that cycle's reload). Reloads reach open app pages live — changed
frontend bundles re-import and their UI slots remount without a page
refresh.

Frontend entries (app.tsx) default-export `definePluginApp` from
`@bb/plugin-sdk/app` and register UI slots: homepageSection (root compose),
settingsSection (per-plugin settings page below the host-rendered settings
form; no props in V1, optional host-rendered title),
navPanel (own sidebar entry + /plugins/<id>/<path>/* route; the remainder
arrives as the component's subPath prop for panel-internal deep links; the
host always renders the shared plugin title bar and the component owns a
zero-padding full-bleed body, including its scrolling),
threadPanelAction
(an entry in the thread right panel's new-tab Actions list whose run() can
open closable panel tabs with recursive `JsonValue` params; restored
components read `JsonValue | null`), pendingInteraction (temporarily replace a thread composer with a
plugin form), fileOpener (register as a per-extension file viewer/editor;
users pick defaults under Settings → File openers and can right-click a
file link for a one-off choice), and messageDirective (replace a leaf
`::name{k="v"}` block inside assistant / nested-agent Markdown with a plugin
component; unknown, disabled, incomplete, code-fenced, or crashing
directives fall back to the original source; components receive a nullable
openWorkspaceFile(path) callback for opening a worktree-relative file in the
host workspace viewer and a nullable
openThreadPanel({ actionId, title?, params? }) callback for opening one of the
same plugin's thread-panel actions). Hooks:
useRpc, useRealtime, useRealtimeConnectionState (the shared realtime socket's
connecting/connected/reconnecting lifecycle; reconcile on later connected
transitions, not the initial connection), useSettings (secrets excluded),
useBbContext,
useBbNavigate, useComposer (read/replace/update/clear scoped composer text,
apply a class-based text effect, lock input, quote selections, insert mention
pills, and focus the composer), and useComposerView (reactive bound scope,
layout, draft, and run state). Plain-text edits preserve attachments and
reconcile only inline mentions overlapped by the edit. Define RPC methods with `defineRpcContract`
and Standard Schema-compatible input/output validators (Zod works directly),
register via `bb.rpc.register(contract, handlers)`, then use a type-only
backend contract import with `useRpc<typeof contract>()` for exact frontend
method/input/result inference. The server validates both schemas and rejects
non-JSON results (including cyclic and non-finite values) with structured
error codes. Components are vendored shadcn source the plugin owns (the
shadcn model): `bb plugin new --app` pre-vendors a starter set into
components/ui/ and `npx shadcn add @bb/<name>` pulls more from the BB
component registry (the full stock shadcn set, version-matched to the
running BB via the pinned ref in components.json). `import { toast } from
"sonner"` reaches the host toaster; react, the portaling radix families,
sonner, vaul, and @pierre/diffs (the app's syntax-highlighted diff
renderer) are runtime-shimmed (never bundled), everything else
bundles from the plugin's node_modules (`npm install` for authors; BB installs
release packages with their declared production dependencies). A crashing slot collapses to a
"plugin <id> crashed" chip without
touching the rest of the app. Installed plugins and their declared settings
(same data as `bb plugin config`) also appear under Extensions → Plugins.

Plugin CLI commands: a plugin can register one top-level subcommand (for
example `bb github …`). Unknown `bb` commands are looked up against installed
plugins and proxied to the server, so plugin commands work exactly like core
commands; core command names always win. Inside agent threads the generated
`plugin-commands` skill lists the available plugin commands.

Settings changes do not auto-reload a plugin — run `bb plugin reload <id>`
after configuring. Add --json to plugin commands for machine-readable output.
Plugin CLI stdout plus stderr is capped at 1,048,576 UTF-8 bytes from the
shared `@bb/plugin-sdk` constant. Results above the ceiling are rejected in
full with a structured `plugin_cli_output_too_large` error; output is never
silently clipped. Page growing collections and use file/streaming commands for
large content.

Authoring a plugin

The loop: `bb plugin new <name>` scaffolds `./bb-plugin-<name>` (add --app
for a frontend entry); `bb plugin install .` registers it; `bb plugin dev`
watches and reloads on every save. The manifest is package.json: required
`bb.name` and `bb.description` human identity, required `bb.branding` with at
least `icon` or `logo.light`, `bb.server`
(backend entry, loaded as TypeScript — no build step), optional `bb.app`
(frontend entry), optional `bb.skills` (static skill directories auto-imported
into agent threads unless filtered by `bb.agents.configure`; default
`skills/`), `engines.bb` (supported bb range),
and optional `engines.bbPluginSdk` (supported plugin SDK range; scaffold
writes `"^0.4.1"` for SDK 0.4.1). The plugin id is the package name minus
`bb-plugin-`.

Plugins can contribute palettes with `bb.themes`: an array of
`{ id, name, description?, css }`, where `css` is a plugin-relative `.css`
file. Loaded plugin palettes appear in Settings → Appearance and `bb theme
list`; their selectable id is `plugin:<plugin-id>:<theme-id>`. Disabling or
removing the owning plugin makes bb fall back to the default palette.

Branding is explicit. Declare `bb.branding.icon` as either the plugin's
canonical BB icon name or a plugin-relative compact SVG such as
`./assets/icon.svg`. BB validates and hash-serves path-shaped SVGs, then
renders them as masks that inherit the surrounding text color. Compact chrome
prefers the manifest icon, then a contribution's local icon hint, and finally
Zap. Roomy surfaces reuse the same icon when no logo override is declared.

Add `bb.branding.logo.light` only for intentionally different rich/full-size
identity artwork; optional `bb.branding.logo.dark` is preferred in dark mode.
Logo paths must be plugin-relative `.svg`, `.png`, or `.webp` files. Root logo
files are not auto-detected, and a dark logo requires a light logo. Logo-only
manifests remain supported for compatibility, so at least an icon or light logo
is required. Do not duplicate the same artwork across fields. BB rejects nulls,
empty strings, missing or escaping assets, and unsupported extensions. Reload
the plugin to pick up branding changes.

The backend entry default-exports a factory receiving the full plugin API:

  import type { BbPluginApi } from "@bb/plugin-sdk";
  export default async function plugin(bb: BbPluginApi) { ... }

The import is type-only and erased at load; the scaffold ships the full API
as bundled .d.ts in types/ (tsconfig maps @bb/plugin-sdk to them), so
`npm install && npx tsc --noEmit` typechecks anywhere — no bb checkout
needed. Confused, or need a symbol the types don't explain? Clone the repo:
https://github.com/get-bb/bb. The API in
one line each — bb.log (plugin-scoped logger behind `bb plugin logs`);
bb.settings.define (declarative settings incl. secrets, editable via
`bb plugin config`); bb.storage.kv (JSON rows ≤256KB) and
bb.storage.database()+migrate (the plugin's own database); bb.sdk (the full
bb SDK — handlers/services only, not the factory; spawned threads are
attributed to the plugin; `visibility: "hidden"` creates directly addressable
background workers omitted from sidebar organization and unread/pending
favicon attention, with other behavior unchanged; a child thread inherits
its parent's visibility and still notifies that parent);
bb.events.on (observe thread.created/idle/failed/deleted);
bb.http.route (routes under /api/v1/plugins/<id>/http/* with
local/token/none auth); defineRpcContract + bb.rpc.register (Standard
Schema-validated frontend data plane with inferred backend handlers and
type-only frontend method/input/result inference);
bb.realtime.publish (ephemeral signals to open app pages);
bb.background.service (long-lived, AbortSignal, restart w/ backoff) and
bb.background.schedule (durable cron rows); bb.cli.register (a top-level
`bb <name>` command agents run through bash, with a shared 1 MiB combined
stdout/stderr ceiling and atomic structured over-limit errors); bb.agents.registerTool
(static native tools with zod or JSON-schema parameters) and
bb.agents.configure (one synchronous per-resolution callback selecting this
plugin's own tool/skill ids and optional dynamic instructions; tools apply on
the next provider session start/resume, while busy skill runtimes defer catalog
changes); bb.ui
registerMentionProvider (host-rendered UI — no
frontend bundle needed); bb.status.needsConfiguration (report
"unconfigured" instead of crashing); bb.onDispose (LIFO cleanup on
reload/disable/shutdown).

Frontend entries register React slots (homepageSection, settingsSection,
navPanel, threadPanelAction, fileOpener, messageDirective) and composer
customizations via `app.composer.customize({ actions, plusMenu, banners,
richText })`; action/banner components use `useComposer()` and
`useComposerView()`, while the host renders plus-menu rows and editor
decorations. The deprecated pre-1.0 `slots.composerAccessory` footer API was
removed; migrate controls to actions or the plus menu and larger content to
banners. Register all frontend surfaces via
definePluginApp, use the hooks
listed above, and render vendored components; styling is Tailwind against
the host theme's tokens only (semantic classes like bg-background and
tw-animate-css utilities compile in plugin builds).

For the complete authoring reference — exact signatures, working snippets
for every surface, the reload lifecycle, testing tips, and gotchas — use
the built-in `bb-plugin-authoring` skill (agents: it loads on demand;
humans: apps/server/src/services/skills/builtin-skills/bb-plugin-authoring/
in a checkout). The builtin `inline-vis` plugin renders
`::inline-vis{file="demo.html" height="480"}` through the sidebar's
path-shaped, sandboxed worktree HTML iframe preview; `height` is optional.
Its card header includes an open-in-sidebar action for the source HTML file.
The `plugins/` directory contains every bundled plugin: the auto-installed
